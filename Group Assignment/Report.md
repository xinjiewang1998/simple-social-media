# [Team Name] Report

The following is a report template to help your team successfully provide all the details necessary for your report in a structured and organised manner. Please give a straightforward and concise report that best demonstrates your project. Note that a good report will give a better impression of your project to the reviewers.

*Here are some tips to write a good report:*

* *Try to summarise and list the `bullet points` of your project as much as possible rather than give long, tedious paragraphs that mix up everything together.*

* *Try to create `diagrams` instead of text descriptions, which are more straightforward and explanatory.*

* *Try to make your report `well structured`, which is easier for the reviewers to capture the necessary information.*

*We give instructions enclosed in square brackets [...] and examples for each sections to demonstrate what are expected for your project report.*

*Please remove the instructions or examples in `italic` in your final report.*

## Conflict Resolution Protocol

1. *Listen to the counterpart.*
2. *Explain to other members.*
3. *Argue with clear text.*
4. *Establish a constructive dialogue.*
5. *Vote for the decision.*

## Application Description

*DrawAndMatch is a social media application specifically designed for artists and people who like painting, It provides painting and matching functions to promote user communication and make friends. For example, users can draw pictures, match friends through the similarity of pictures, send messages directly between friends, like and favorite posts, have a user-friendly UI, and so on. *

**Application Use Cases and or Examples**

*Targets Users: Painters and people who like painting*

* *Users can draw a picture they like.*
* *Users can match with similar person base on the image*

*Targets Users: People watching the Forum*

* *Users can search and view others posts.*
* *Users can chat to the author of post.*
* *Users can interact with posts, such like and favorites.*

## Application Design and Decisions

*Please give clear and concise descriptions for each subsections of this part. It would be better to list all the concrete items for each subsection and give no more than `5` concise, crucial reasons of your design. Here is an example for the subsection `Data Structures`:*

*I used the following data structures in my project:*

**Data Structures**
1. *B+TreeMap*
   * *Objective: It is used for indexing posts.*

   * *Locations: BTree directory*

   * *Reasons:*

      * *a modified b+tree to support multi-values for the same key and range search*
      * *search requires O(logn)*

2. *HashSet*
   * *Objective: It is used for removing duplicates.*

   * *Locations: AndExp, NotExp, OrExp.*

   * *Reasons:*

      * *Fast removing duplicates based on hash*
      * *simple ops to do union, intersect, not.*

3. *Hashmap [string] object -/- firebase*
   * *Objective: It is used in firebase and decoding json.*


4. *ArrayList*
   * *Many other places*
    
**Design Patterns**

**Iterator**
*Inside posts to iterate through things.*
**Singleton**
*Inside paint to wrap a websocket, so it is not initialised everytime and save connections.*

**Grammars**

*Search Engine*

* <exp> ::= <term> | <term> AND <exp> | <term> OR <exp>
  <br>
* <term>   ::=  <factor> | NOT <factor>
  <br>
* <factor> ::= <user> | <tag> | ( expression )

**Tokenizer and Parsers**

use tokenizer and parser to parse user search, hence we could build query on it, including and, or, union.

## Implemented Features

*UI Design and Testing*

2. *UI tests using espresso or similar. Please note that your tests must be of reasonable quality. (For UI testing, you may use something such as espresso) a. Espresso is not covered in lectures/labs, but is a simple framework to write Android UI tests. (hard) *

*Greater Data Usage, Handling and Sophistication*

2. *User profile activity containing a media file (image, animation (e.g. gif), video). (easy)*

*User Interactivity*

1. *The ability to micro-interact with 'posts' (e.g. like, report, etc.) [stored in-memory].(easy)*

*Peer to Peer Messaging*

1. *Provide users with the ability to message each other directly. (hard)*

*Firebase Integration*

1. *Use Firebase to implement user Authentication/Authorisation. (easy)*
2. *Use Firebase to persist all data used in your app (this item replace the requirement to retrieve data from a local file) (medium)*

*New feature*

1. *Paint and matching similar graphs. (hard)*
