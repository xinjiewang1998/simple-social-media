Here are some tips for the project:\nGet twinning. Whether you dress up friends identically or capture a mirror image of the moon on a lake, get creative with how the concept of \u201ctwinning\u201d can show up in photos and videos.\nConsider classic duos. Find objects that come together for your composition. Think of a knife and fork, cereal and milk, or even sticks and stones.\nMatch unlikely pairs. Go beyond identical images or classic duos by playing with the way people and objects relate. Take a photo of a friend in a green sweater enjoying a matcha ice-cream cone, or have a sibling stretch out in the same shape of your favorite backyard tree.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPmatching hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video shared over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week."},

Consider the range of motions you can document that reflect different feelings or emotions, like the quiet and soothing way wind gently blows your friend\u2019s hair, or the high-energy action of your sibling splashing in a pool. \nPlan the capture. The way you document movement can bring another dimension to your #WHPmotion submission. For example, you could blur the action by tracking the motion of a bright car as it drives through a busy junction to create an abstract environment, or you could capture a cat midair as it jumps down from the furniture for a freeze-frame effect.\n\nPlay with creative tools. Slow motion or time-lapse can exaggerate the mood and movement in your submission, or multiple exposures can track multiple positions of someone moving through your frame. \nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPmotion hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Here are some tips to get you started:\nCapture a familiar subject or scene from an unexpected angle. Get up close and let a face cover the entire frame, or make a puppy look large by shooting from ground-level as she stares down. Find a high vantage point to show the wider context of a festival scene or bustling market.\nUse geometry to your advantage. Look for graphic lines \u2014 in bridges or telephone wires \u2014 that converge to a vanishing point in your composition. Find a new way to capture patterns in everyday places, like the wheels of bicycles lined up in a rack, or symmetrical bricks in an unruly garden.\nPlay an eye trick. Defy gravity with simple editing, like rotating the frame. Recruit a friend to make a well-timed leap, that, when rotated, looks like they\u2019re flying through air. Or turn a dandelion into a human-size parasol by playing with scale and distance.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPperspective hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Due to ivory poaching and climate change, more and more elephants are in need of care and protection. Reteti was founded in 2016 by the native Samburu people to meet that need. \u201cThis place is 100 percent indigenously owned and run, which makes it different from every other elephant sanctuary, where there are a lot of outsiders and volunteers,\u201d says Ami. \u201cIt\u2019s really unique, and it gives the Samburu people a lot of pride. I want people to know about this place because it\u2019s incredibly inspiring, and could be a blueprint for others.\u201d \ud83d\udc18\n\nToday is #WorldElephantDay.

First, Instagram is now a global community of one billion! Since our launch in 2010, we\u2019ve watched with amazement as the community has flourished and grown. This is a major accomplishment \u2014 so from all of us at Instagram, thank you!\nSecond, we\u2019re announcing our most exciting feature to date: IGTV, a new app for watching long-form, vertical video from your favorite Instagram creators, like LaurDIY (@laurdiy) posting her newest project or King Bach (@kingbach) sharing his latest comedy skit. While there\u2019s a stand-alone IGTV app, you\u2019ll also be able to watch from within the Instagram app so the entire community of one billion can use it from the very start.\nIGTV is different in a few ways. First, it\u2019s built for how you actually use your phone, so videos are full screen and vertical. Also, unlike on Instagram, videos aren\u2019t limited to one minute. Instead, each video can be up to an hour long.\nWe made it simple, too.

Here are some tips to get you started:\nUse a window to frame a specific subject, be it a lone tree outside the office or a ray of light coming into your kitchen. Look at the frame from many angles to find the most compelling one.\nFocus on the textures and details of a window \u2014 the curve of old glass, the modern metal latches or eye-catching figurines on the windowsill.\nStep back from the window to get a sense of scale. Notice how sets of windows fit together, emphasizing both the functionality and fragility of their design, or focus on the structure of the walls surrounding them.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPwindows hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week."},

But he\u2019s not ready to step into anyone else\u2019s shoes. \u201cA lot of people ask me if I want to go to culinary school. I tell them I want to take my own path,\u201d he says. A recent food obsession of Josh\u2019s? Ramen. \u201cRecently, I went on a trip with my parents and my sister to Japan. I actually had 30 bowls of ramen in order to try the different styles,\u201d he says. \u201cThe best meal I\u2019ve ever had wasn\u2019t at a restaurant with super fancy tableware and linens; it was at basically a hole-in-the-wall place, and was because of the experience of sitting there, of being in awe of the bowl of ramen and being in Japan itself. That was the experience where I probably learned the most.\u201d \ud83c\udf5c\nWatch our Instagram story to see how Josh works his culinary magic in the kitchen."},

Since the beginning, we\u2019ve tried to make Instagram a welcoming place for everyone. Our community has grown to 800 million, with 500 million using it every day. It\u2019s more important than ever to strengthen our commitment to safety and kindness.\nOver time, we\u2019ve launched a number of tools to help you manage the comments experience, and today we\u2019re introducing more. Starting today, if your account is public, you\u2019ll see a new way to choose who can comment on your posts \u2014 from everyone to just groups of people, like people you follow or your followers. Also, whether your account is public or private, you\u2019ll be able to block other accounts from commenting on your posts. In June, we launched a filter to block certain offensive comments in English, today we are expanding this filter to Arabic, French, German and Portuguese. The filter will improve over time, enabling the community\u2019s experience of sharing to improve as well.\nWe\u2019re continuing to provide mental health resources to you when you need them most. If you see someone going through a difficult time or in need of support during a live broadcast, you can report it anonymously. The person will see a message offering help with options to talk to a helpline, reach out to a friend or get other tips and support. We have teams working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, around the world to respond.\nWe feel as strongly about creating a safe and welcoming environment today as we did when our community was just getting started. To learn more about these tools and others, visit Instagram-Together.com. Thank you for being on this journey with us, and for taking care of each other.\nKevin Systrom\nCo-Founder & CEO"},

This week, the goal is to create photos and videos that capture energy and movement, as in this featured photo by Filipe Costa (@filipefoto). Here are some tips to get you started:\nUse Instagram\u2019s creative tools to showcase kinetic energy in your daily life. Try a Boomerang of a morning running group or a Hyperlapse of an arena filling up with fans. Or make a Rewind in Instagram Stories of your dog playing fetch then share your video to your feed.\nDecide on a type of movement you want to focus on \u2014 sporting events, urban commutes, fall activities like apple picking \u2014 and go get in on the action. Let your camera lens draw your eye toward the most animated parts of the setting.\nConsider a scene that might at first glance appear calm and still. Where can you find the subtle forces of energy, and how can you highlight them in a single image?\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPdynamic hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week."},

Part of what we need to do as a society is to bring those together and retrain ourselves to be kind.\u201d\nTo celebrate #WWIM16\ud83d\udc8c\u2019s theme of #KindComments, join Hello!Lucky on September 8 with Harlow & Grey (@harlowandgrey) and Le Marais Bakery (@lemaraisbakery) for their San Francisco InstaMeet.\nWatch our Instagram story to see some of Hello!Lucky\u2019s pun-tastic drawings."},

Here are some tips to get you started:\nVisit the kitchens where your favorite meals are made: Re-create a family recipe at a relative\u2019s house, capture the tried and true pots and pans hanging above your kitchen sink or the scars on a friend\u2019s cheese board at Friday night dinner.\nPeople tend to gather in a home\u2019s kitchen. Record Boomerangs or videos that capture the energy of a group of family members and friends around food and drink.\nKitchens don\u2019t have to exist between four built walls. What are some nontraditional, makeshift kitchens you found yourself in this weekend, like a street food cart or a campfire?\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPinthekitchen hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week."},

While some of Esteban\u2019s recipes are traditional Mexican, others are a fusion, a nod to both his heritage and his upbringing in one dish. \u201cHonestly,\u201d he says, \u201cI can\u2019t even distinguish between what\u2019s Mexican and what\u2019s American anymore.\u201d\nPhoto by @chicanoeats"},

What immediately catches your eye? Let yourself be drawn naturally to colors, shapes and movements, and then work those into your photos, videos or Boomerangs.\nThink of someone in your life whose personality stands out from the crowd. How can you capture that spirit or ethos in a photograph?\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPstandout hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Take a photo of a thoughtful gift you were given, or a Hyperlapse of a helpful friend painting your kitchen with you.\nShow friends coming together, from gathering around the dinner table for a shared meal to a pickup soccer game.\nKeep an eye out for surprising or unlikely friendships: a dog and a cat snoozing together in a sunspot, a vine reaching out for a neighboring tree or a child embracing her new toy.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPfriendship hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

I knew I had to do something, and I felt like youth needed a role. So, I invited local media, our mayor, city council members and our police chief to a meeting where I presented my idea for an organization. That was the start of Kinston Teens, a nonprofit that empowers young people through service, leadership and civic engagement. My work there led me to become the youngest recipient ever of the FBI Director\u2019s Community Leadership Award. And this past January, when the vice provost of admissions gave me a call personally telling me I was accepted into @uncchapelhill, I was overjoyed. I\u2019m so excited to stay close to my community and continue to make a difference.\nThree things I\u2019m grateful for:\n\ud83d\ude4c My organization, @kinstonteens.

They are definitely my biggest role models and always have been, throughout their entire time in office.\n\ud83d\ude4c My parents. My mom is a teacher, and my dad works for our local government.

Document your family settling in for dinner or take a Boomerang of your friends hitting the town.\nFocus on light. Whether it\u2019s the blue hue of dusk spreading over your neighborhood or a city skyline illuminated against the night sky, notice how light changes and evolves from bright to dim.\nLook beyond your immediate circle \u2014 how do other people react to the shift from day to night? Take a portrait of a server heading to work or a video of downtown streets emptying as office workers head home.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPgoodnight hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

Mountains, beaches, plains, forests \u2014 our land is diverse and grand, and it would take lifetimes to experience it all. How much can you capture within the frame of one photograph or video? Look for action and movement within the larger scene.\nFocus on the smaller details. Our planet may be vast, but there are millions of tiny, beautiful moments playing out in front of us every day: a blooming flower pushing through the cracks in the sidewalk, a trickle of water feeding a small pool in the forest or a tree swaying gently in the breeze.\nKeep an eye out for how nature weaves its way into man-made scenes. City and country alike have their own elements of natural beauty.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPnaturalbeauty hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

She told us to go to an audition.\nThere were about 80 people there, but in the end, I was the only one they chose. I love dance, especially seeing people enjoy what you\u2019re doing.

San Francisco-based architect Dan Hogman (@danhogman) tackles these questions during his sketching work: \u201cArchitecture brings a sense of stability and timelessness,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore you get into the discussion on what it means or how it functions, a basic question is always current \u2014 how to represent it? How to capture the essence in just a few strokes, whether it\u2019s a single structure or a citywide scene,\u201d says Dan, who makes daily drawings of settings and buildings that inspire him.\nHere\u2019s how to get started on your own submission this weekend:\nDocument what happens when you sit down at the literal (or figurative) drawing board. When you put pen to paper \u2014 or brush to canvas \u2014 show what emerges, and how.\nTry exploring beyond what you might consider a typical creative process. How does a child line up her crayons? A bike repairman lay out his tools? Take note of the not-so-obvious creativity happening around you.\nExperiment with different ways of capturing a creative process \u2014 like a Hyperlapse of a mural coming to life or a Boomerang of an artist at work in her studio.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPhowicreate hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.\nFeatured photo by @danhogman"},

I had an eating disorder. I doubted myself and my place in this world. I came to the yoga mat as a physical practice \u2014 I thought it was going to keep me flexible and strong. What it ended up being was a big overhaul of my life. After I had been teaching yoga for four years, I realized if someone had taught me how to breathe, if someone listened to me from a place of compassion at 14 years old, my life would\u2019ve looked a lot different. The work I do with Girlvana keeps me so accountable, and so real and transparent about my relationship to my body and food.\nEmbedded in its philosophy, yoga has this this intrinsic self-care and kindness that this is your one chance, your one vehicle, and to honor and find love and compassion for your body is much more fruitful than being at war with yourself.\u201d\nPhoto by @allymaz"},

Swipe right into the camera to take a photo or video, then tap the arrow to send it privately. You can choose a group or create one in just a few taps \u2014 and you can also send to individual friends at the same time. Send anything you want, from inside jokes to your worst selfies. Unlike other messages in Direct, these photos and videos disappear from your friends\u2019 inboxes after they have seen them. And you\u2019ll see if they replayed it or took a screenshot.\nTo open your inbox, tap the new paper airplane icon at the top right corner of your feed or swipe left. You\u2019ll see disappearing photos and videos in a bar at the top. Tap the ones with blue rings to see what your friends sent you. In a group, you can see everyone\u2019s responses \u2014 and who else has seen them \u2014 in a slideshow format.

The experiment to color dough using vegetables and spices was wildly successful. And with a few knives and cookie cutters, she\u2019s making the intricate patterns on her ravioli, fettuccine and farfalle. \u201cI considered my background in art, and obsession with fashion, and tried to figure out ways to put these really cool, vibrant and good-for-you colors together in ways that would also be fun, appealing and eye-catching,\u201d she says.\n\nYears later, Linda, who is based in Seattle, has no shortage of ideas \u2014 she often has 30 different colors of dough in her fridge and finds inspiration everywhere. \u201cIf I feel blocked, I get out into the world,\u201d says Linda. \u201cBefore long, the ideas are churning out like little pasta butterflies.\u201d \ud83c\udf5d\nPhoto by @saltyseattle"},

Images have the ability to inspire and bring out the best in us, whether they are funny, sad or beautiful. Over the past five years, I\u2019ve watched in wonder as this community has grown to 500 million, with stories from every corner of the world. With this growth, we want to work diligently to maintain what has kept Instagram positive and safe, especially in the comments on your photos and videos.\n\nThe beauty of the Instagram community is the diversity of its members. All different types of people \u2014 from diverse backgrounds, races, genders, sexual orientations, abilities and more \u2014 call Instagram home, but sometimes the comments on their posts can be unkind. To empower each individual, we need to promote a culture where everyone feels safe to be themselves without criticism or harassment. It\u2019s not only my personal wish to do this, I believe it\u2019s also our responsibility as a company. So, today, we\u2019re taking the next step to ensure Instagram remains a positive place to express yourself.\n\nThe first feature we\u2019re introducing is a keyword moderation tool that anyone can use. Now, when you tap the gear icon on your profile, you\u2019ll find a new Comments tool. This feature lets you list words you consider offensive or inappropriate. Comments with these words will be hidden from your posts. You can choose your own list of words or use default words we\u2019ve provided. This is in addition to the tools we\u2019ve already developed such as swiping to delete comments, reporting inappropriate comments and blocking accounts.\n\nWe know tools aren\u2019t the only solution for this complex problem, but together we can work toward keeping Instagram a safe place for self-expression. My commitment to you is that we will keep building features that safeguard the community and maintain what makes Instagram a positive and creative place for everyone.\n\nTo learn more about comments on Instagram, check out help.instagram.com.\n\nKevin Systrom\nCEO & Co-founder, Instagram"},

There is not one trend. There is not one sort of orientation.\u201d\nGet your subjects\u2019 stories: \u201cIt\u2019s really about cultural storytelling: that it\u2019s raw, candid and in the moment. And that I, personally, have a high degree of empathy toward the subjects.\u201d Anka adds, \u201cHave no fear of approaching someone. If they are wearing something that wants to be seen, they love to be acknowledged about it.\u201d\nDon\u2019t forget about the backdrop \u2014 a key part of the portrait template according to Anka. Whether you\u2019re capturing a candid moment on the street or a more posed portrait, chose a setting with colors, patterns and lighting that interact with your subject\u2019s look.\nProject RULES: Please add the #WHPstyle hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.\nPhoto by @the_line_up"},

Here\u2019s how to get started:\nTransform any photo or video from your Instagram story into a doodle masterpiece by mixing and matching the built-in drawing tools and then share directly to your feed!\nDon\u2019t feel confined to a pencil and paper: Experiment with drawing in the sand, foggy windows or any other canvas that you find. Use Boomerang to capture a satisfying final touch, like the last loop to close a flower.\nSet your phone or camera on a steady surface (or a tripod) and envision the fixed frame as a blank page to be filled. Think big: If you point your lens at an empty sidewalk, fill the entire frame with chalk art.\nChallenge yourself to try something new. For example, have a friend record your attempt to draw with your eyes closed or draw an urban scene without letting yourself lift your drawing utensil from the surface you\u2019re drawing on. Be sure your video shows the context that makes your drawing experiment unique.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPdrawit hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.\nFeatured video by @smcmennamy"},

I like to mix iconic sports audio with new visuals to make something that feels classic but new at the same time. The first phase is writing (researching and finding the right audio clips). I\u2019m always writing in my head when I\u2019m watching sports, but I end up making less than half of my ideas. The second is building sets and armatures. Then I animate \u2014 most of my animations are 12 photos per second.

It seems like it\u2019s a plastic circle that won\u2019t have any power to transform you physically and mentally and energetically, but it changed the way I talked to myself. I started encouraging myself to learn and play versus me being perfect and better than anyone in the room. That\u2019s what I love about the hoop. Once I\u2019m in there, I feel like I enter a space where there\u2019s no judgment, no resistance to anything or anyone or any thought.\n\nWhen I created the niqab hoop series, I was inspired to combine the practice of play and the physical constraint of the veil. It\u2019s shocking but enchanting. I feel like I\u2019m always boldly walking on eggshells.\u201d\nVideo by @balqis_alrashed"},

People began sharing these images, saying I was photogenic and recommending me for modeling jobs. This is how I became a plus-sized model.\n\nI don\u2019t want other girls or women to have to go through the same thing I did in order to learn to love themselves. I learned the hard way that the only way to be happy is to hold your head up high and have the maximum amount of love and respect for yourself.\u201d\nPhoto by @mayaraefe"},

The unlucky chick is always trying to escape the page, assisted by glass bottles, seesaws and other drawn objects. \u201cFor a 15-second animation, I usually produce 100 to 200 illustrations,\u201d Wahyu explains, adding that he smooths each animation out on the computer. Along with his own projects, he sometimes collaborates with his wife and children at their home studio in Queens, New York. Credit for the whimsy in Wahyu\u2019s work belongs to his kids. \u201cWhen we \u2018teach\u2019 them about art, they teach us back about so many things, [like] how to bring childhood imagination back to our adult life.\u201d\nVideo by @pinot"},

Here\u2019s how to get started:\nFocus on making visuals that depict seemingly impossible situations \u2014 like your own hand picking up a skyscraper, or the sun resting atop a friend\u2019s head.\n\nShoot from a variety of perspectives so objects appear smaller or larger in your images than in real life. For example, make a toy action figure look life-size by shooting it from close-up and at a low angle.\n\nPlace objects on different planes in your frame to warp the sense of scale. Keep in mind that whatever\u2019s in the foreground of your picture will appear the largest.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPeyetricks hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.\n\nFor more examples and inspiration, check out blog.instagram.com\n\nFeatured photo by @el.rex"},

For the future, I want to learn a lot more tricks and stuff, maybe even do some slopestyle next year.

I\u2019m 25 years old and live in Los Angeles, California. I started a blog, The Blonde Vegan, to document my vegan journey when I was in college. Years later, I decided to pursue my blog full time, and I simultaneously experienced a lot of health problems like low energy, hair loss, really bad skin and anxiety \u2014 mainly anxiety about food. I stumbled upon the word orthorexia, which means an obsession with pure, healthy, clean foods from the earth and a fear and avoidance of anything that doesn\u2019t fall under that category. That sounded like me.\n\nI knew I had to give myself more variety and let go of \u2018The Blonde Vegan\u2019 label, allowing myself to evolve and change and listen to my body and my heart. I wanted to pick a name that would last no matter what; it became clear to me that \u2018The Balanced Blonde\u2019 was everything that I was trying to be. Finding balance is a process and you\u2019re allowed to have off days. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as important to strive for a \u2018perfect\u2019 state of recovery where you never look back.

Make sure your subject stands still to avoid blurriness in low light.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPnocturnal hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

An active member of his church\u2019s youth organization, Wilfredo and his friends sell food to fund programs for those less fortunate. \u201cCelebrating Christmas is sure fun in the Philippines, especially when you put faith, family and fun together,\u201d Wilfredo says.

This week marks 30 years since the natural disaster changed Epecu\u00e9n forever.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to take coherent photos of the chaos. There\u2019s no order, no symmetry,\u201d says Vanessa, who recently spent two days exploring the ghostly landscape. \u201cI felt I was there for a week or a month, time runs in a different way.\u201d\nPhoto by @viajarenfoco"},

Whether it\u2019s chilling silence, or the creepy creaking of a floorboard \u2014 find ways to incorporate ambient noise in your videos that adds to the scariness of the scene. If you use music in your video submissions, please be sure to only use music to which you own the rights.\n\nBuild up suspense in your videos by starting with a quiet scene that culminates in a shocking payoff. Make videos with surprise spooky endings \u2014 and don\u2019t be afraid to use humor for a more playful ending as well.\n\nCostumes and props are central to Halloween. Dress up with your friends to create frightening-looking characters, and film a bone-chilling video around them. Be sure to find a location that adds to the haunted vibe.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPspooky hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Shortly after the wall was completed, Rashid knocked it down. \u201c2015 feels like it is a year of wall-building around the world, and the potential of the collapse of these walls is an ambition and ever-expanding concern of my practice.\u201d\nPhoto by @rashidjohnson"},

But there is a whole world of pasta lovers out there, and Miyuki Adachi (@miyukiadachi) of Osaka, Japan, is the ultimate pasta geek, despite having never stepped foot in Italy.\n\nA British and American literature graduate, Miyuki was unsure about her future when she finished college. Little did she know her destiny was held in her own name (Miyuki means \u201cdeeply happy\u201d in Japanese). After much soul-searching, she realized what made her most happy was kneading dough and artfully shaping it \u2014 so she became a professional cook.\n\nCurrently working as the lead pasta-maker at a restaurant in Toronto, Canada, Miyuki forms all kinds of pasta, but one of her favorites is strascinati, which requires a technique of \u201cdragging\u201d the pasta. \u201cI love the feeling of the knife pulling over the layers of pasta dough,\u201d she says. When it comes to her favorite pasta dish to eat, Miyuki has no doubts: \u201cOrecchiette, because of its chewiness and ability to hold sauce well,\u201d says Miyuki. \u201cI serve it with broccoli raab, garlic and anchovy with toasted bread crumbs. It is really simple and has a clean flavor.\u201d\nVideo by @miyukiadachi"},

Jacqui, whose mother taught her to knit as a child, returned to the craft after a career in law and being bolstered by a moment of inspiration. \u201cI had a vision, which transformed my life and opened the door to extreme knitting. While I was asleep, a big, loud booming voice said to me, \u2018You have to knit, and it needs to be big.\u2019 The command was as terrifying as it was profound,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was no way I wasn\u2019t going to listen to it.\u201d\nJacqui uses high-grade merino roving, yarn and wools sourced from Australia and New Zealand. Effectively handling delicate merino wool on a large scale took her over two years of research and experimentation. She sits on an armless chair to support the needles \u2014 over three and a half feet (110 centimeters) long, made of PVC plumber\u2019s pipe with hand-turned timber ends \u2014 and the weight of the wool, which can be 11 pounds (5 kilograms) for an average throw. \u201cThe terrific thing about extreme knitting is that you get rewarded very quickly for all your hard work. You can knit yourself a scarf in an hour, a throw in four and king-size blanket in six,\u201d she says.\n\nPhoto by @jacquifink"},

Control your backdrop by framing the desired scene in camera, then photographing your subject as they pass through the frame.\n\nTry placing your camera low to the ground and shooting upward at your subject for a more dramatic perspective.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPactionpacked hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Try shooting your photos and videos from a distance to show the movement of your subject. Keep an eye and ear out for natural rhythms in your environment, like ocean waves or a branch blowing in the wind.\n\nUse both the #WHPrhythm and #MHPrhythm hashtags this weekend and #MHPrhythm the rest of the month for more opportunities to be featured, and see more examples and inspiration on blog.instagram.com.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPrhythm hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

The full-sized version will show up in feed in a beautiful, natural way. To not disrupt your profile grid, your post will appear there as a center-cropped square.\nWe\u2019re especially excited about what this update means for video on Instagram.

Some tips to get you started:\nStrong texture photos evoke a sense of touch. Look for rough, cracked, soft, prickly, fluffy and all kinds of surfaces that make viewers immediately think of how something feels. Look for textures in unconventional places. Look past walls and fabrics to the natural environment around you and the textures in leaves, fur, everyday objects and even skin. Side-lit materials and surfaces highlight textures much better than subjects faced directly with a light source.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPtexture hashtag only to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project. Any tagged image taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured Monday morning.\nFor more examples and inspiration, check out blog.instagram.com.\nFeatured photo by @pixie.zi"},

Our inspiration for the challenge comes from Brazilian photographer C\u00e9sar Ovalle (@cesinha), who created the #sayhitothewater hashtag. Some tips to get you started: \nMake sure to look beyond the puddle and get creative about where you might find interesting reflections. If you are in a dry area, fountains, glass and swimming pools can all reveal natural mirrors. Greetings come in many shapes and forms. Be bold when it comes to striking a pose with your hands, legs and feet. \u201cDoing something unconventional is always worth a try,\u201d suggests C\u00e9sar. Focus on reflections that have interesting backgrounds but are not too polluted. Make sure the surface beneath the water is clean. If it\u2019s too dirty, it can damage the end result. Pay attention to your style. \u201cWear interesting shoes,\u201d encourages C\u00e9sar.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPsayhitothewater hashtag only to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project. Any tagged image taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured Monday morning.\n\nFor more examples and inspiration, check out blog.instagram.com. \nFeatured photo by @gabriel.palermo"},

On a windy day, the breeze moving through long hair can lend itself to beautiful video portraits \u2014 especially if filmed in slow motion. Sharpen your street photography skills and keep an eye out for interesting hairstyles in the wild. Snap from afar or respectfully approach and ask to take a portrait. Or, if you can\u2019t find anything interesting, get creative. Grab a willing friend and break out the hairspray to see what you can create. Finally, as with all photos of people, keep light in mind as you shoot. Take advantage of an overcast sky or nearby window for softer portrait light, or go out into direct sun for bold shadows.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPhairplay hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs and videos to the project.

Try to capture the essence of a personality, and don't be afraid to capture unscripted moments as well. Clothes and setting also help convey a sense of personality.

Some tips to get you started: \nLook for all the different sources of light that can illuminate an interesting scene around you, including street lamps, flashlights, candles and moonlight. The glowing lights of buildings and bridges at night offer a great opportunity for cityscapes. Remember to hold your camera as still as possible for the longer exposure required in a low light setting. To prevent your photo or video from being too bright or grainy, tap and hold the brightest part of your frame to adjust and lock the exposure. If you\u2019re celebrating Independence Day in the United States this weekend, try to capture the unique light effects of fireworks and sparklers. (Just remember to maintain a safe distance.) PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPnightlights hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs and videos to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

Andrew's preferred altering techniques include emulsion lifts, where a Polaroid is soaked in hot water until the top emulsion layer floats off of the backing and is transferred and manipulated to a new surface. As well as double exposures, where you trick the camera into releasing the shutter twice exposing two different images in a single Polaroid. Lately, Andrew started adding to his creative process: He applies layers of paint or gold leaf to the final instant photo before digitally enlarging the artwork to be screen-printed. \nPhoto by @andrewjmillar"},

Look for ways to capture light and dark versions of the same color in one picture to add more depth to your frame. Think big and small in scale. Monochromatic could look like a gray cityscape of concrete buildings on a smoggy day or a portrait of a friend whose clothing blends in with their surroundings. Find a way to incorporate a variety of textures and patterns in your image while still sticking to one overall color scheme.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPmonochromatic hashtag only to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project.

Each of his videos shows a close-up on the drum, with his hands skipping across the surface like pebbles on water. \u201cA lot of players just come along and belt them.The thing is, if you strike it too hard you detune the instrument quite quickly, because it is hand hammered,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cFor me it was a little bit easier to adapt. But it\u2019s been a constant learning curve.\u201d #Instrumental\n\nFor more handpan videos, follow @adrian_portia.

Some tips to get you started:\n\nSetting is everything for this project. Look for scenes like crosswalks or parks that naturally feature lots of motion. Frame your shot, hit record, then hold your camera as still as possible while you capture the action. Alternatively, stage a scene as you would a photo then stage motion within the fixed frame, such as a person walking through the frame or a hand reaching in to remove something. Finally, for the most stable shot possible, film your shot with Hyperlapse and play it back at 1x speed.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPholdstill hashtag only to videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own videos to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights.

The goal is to capture moments that might often be overlooked, because they fall outside the classical lighting condition known as \u201cgolden hour.\u201d Here are some tips to get you started:\n\nWhile we're often taught that a subject should face the light, experiment with backlit situations, or with light that illuminates the subject from an angle we don\u2019t often see.\n\nExplore times of the day or night that you might have avoided because they seemed too bright or too dark. While dawn and dusk are popular for the warm, soft, side lighting that they yield, try photographing in the harsh, overhead light at high noon \u2014 or venture into the darkness, to see where light emerges.\n\nInstead of relying solely on daylight-balanced natural light, experiment with the color shifts that occur with artificial lighting from sources like computer devices and fluorescent bulbs, or with light refracted by atmospheric conditions like dust or moisture.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPstrangelight hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own images to the project.

The goal is to capture surprising combinations of food that look good and taste good. This week\u2019s project takes inspiration from the food-themed Instagram account @nourishandevolve, run by 16-year-old chef Tina Gan from Melbourne, Australia.\n\nHere are some tips to get you started from Tina: \u201cPlay around with the placement of the food. Don\u2019t always place it dead center. Try and use some props to fill up the empty spaces in the photo - cutlery, linen and raw ingredients all work great. Always use natural lighting. Try taking your food photos next to a window during the day when there is plenty of light. Having a variety of colorful ingredients always helps, but it also matters how you assemble the dish. Sometimes the messiness is what makes the photo. But wipe down the sides of the plate to get rid of the splatters, if required.\u201d PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPcolorfulcooking hashtag only to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project. Any tagged image taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured Monday morning.\n\nFor more examples and inspiration, check out blog.instagram.com. \nFeatured photo by @nourishandevolve"},

As you shoot, aim to highlight similarities while also celebrating differences. For example, focus on the ways identical twins differ or how an odd couple can come together. Put thought into your composition. Play with distance, perspective and framing, and use your setting to add context or tell a story.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPdoubletake hashtag only to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project.

On Wednesday, after Gisele's final runway walk at S\u00e3o Paulo Fashion Week (@spfw), Bob was called upon to capture Gisele\u2019s bittersweet goodbye. For Bob, the most emotional moment wasn\u2019t backstage with Gisele, but watching her walk in the show. \u201cIt was very beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cShe and I both cried, and later we talked about that. She asked, \u2018Why do I get emotional?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Because you are human.\u2019\u201d Throwback photo of Gisele, stylist Silvio Giorgio and Bob by @lucianaprezia"},

Some tips to get you started: \nIf you\u2019re not used to sketching, don\u2019t let a new medium intimidate you. Whether it\u2019s on sticky notes and napkins or in your best sketchbook, grab a pen and let the world around you flow onto the paper. No matter how much your drawing does or doesn\u2019t resemble your subject, be proud of what you\u2019ve created and share it anyway. Illustration opens up a blank canvas of new possibilities. Be as inventive or as abstract as you want to be and let your imagination run wild. Finally, use your caption to help fill in the details of the scene. Share details like sounds, smells and feelings to make your sketch come alive.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPidrewthis hashtag only to photos taken over this weekend and only submit your own photographs to the project. Any tagged image taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured Monday morning.\n\nFor more examples and inspiration, check out blog.instagram.com.\n\nFeatured photo by @little_sketchy"},

Yumi\u2019s nail paintings began as something she did just for fun aside from her work, but as more people started noticing them through her photos and videos, her nail art has evolved to the point where she conducts live demonstrations at public events. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t much to it, but I always try to look for new themes,\u201d she says. According to Yumi, the challenging part about nail painting is drawing with her less dominant hand, explaining that it\u2019s more about practice rather than technique. Most of the colorful characters that Yumi draws are people, cats and birds. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to choose my favorite, but I would have to go with \u2018the cat eating breakfast\u2019 \u2014 this is a character that was first drawn on my nails and later ended up in my artwork,\u201d she says. \u201cThe character seemed to develop on its own, and I find that interesting.\u201d Video by @yumikitagishi"},

When Haley Decker (@thesecondgleam) and her boyfriend Darren Erbe (@darrenerbe) first began visiting the island with hopes of photographing the animals, they were only met with paw prints disappearing into the dunes. Toward the end of winter, however, when fewer people frequented the park, their luck changed. \u201cWe parked in a huge empty parking lot, and all of a sudden foxes started popping up out of nowhere from all directions,\u201d says Haley. The pair worked as a team to photograph the animals, being sure to keep their distance as they did so. \u201cWe just both approached them slowly and we switched off between shooting with an iPhone or a digital camera.
